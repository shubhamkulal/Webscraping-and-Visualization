## Project Description

The Webscraping and Visualization project aims to provide examples and scripts for extracting data from websites using web scraping techniques. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook file with the web scraping code and a Power BI dashboard file for data visualization.

## Installation

To use the resources and files in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

### Web Scraping

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (webscraping.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Go through the code in the notebook to configure and customize the web scraping code.
3. Run the notebook cells to perform the web scraping and save the scraped data to the Excel file.

### Data Visualization

1. Install Power BI Desktop, which can be downloaded from the official Power BI website.
2. Open the Power BI dashboard file (visualization.pbix) in Power BI Desktop.
3. Connect the dashboard to the dataset Excel file (dataset.xlsx) generated from the web scraping process.
4. Explore the pre-built visualizations and interact with the dashboard to analyze the data.
5. Modify the dashboard as needed to suit your specific visualization requirements.

##### TIP : I have already uploaded dataset which is cleaned and yes you can also modify it as per your requirements (Create Measures).

### Usage

1. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook file (webscraping.ipynb) to perform web scraping and save the data to the Excel file (dataset.xlsx).
2. Open the Power BI dashboard file (visualization.pbix) in Power BI Desktop to visualize and analyze the scraped data.
3. Customize the notebook and the dashboard as per your specific needs and requirements
